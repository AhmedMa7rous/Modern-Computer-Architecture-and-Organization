__Modern Computer Architecture and Organization__, by Jim Ledin. Published by Packt Publishing.

This book presents the key technologies and components employed in modern processor
and computer architectures and discusses how various architectural decisions result in
computer configurations optimized for specific needs.

To understate the situation quite drastically, modern computers are complicated devices.
Yet, when viewed in a hierarchical manner, the functions of each level of complexity
become clear. We will cover a great many topics in these chapters and will only have
the space to explore each of them to a limited degree. My goal is to provide a coherent
introduction to each important technology and subsystem you might find in a modern
computing device and explain its relationship to other system components.

This book is intended for software developers, computer engineering students, system
designers, computer science professionals, reverse engineers, and anyone else seeking to
understand the architecture and design principles underlying all types of modern computer
systems from tiny embedded devices to smartphones to warehouse-sized cloud server farms.
Readers will also explore the directions these technologies are likely to take in the coming
years. A general understanding of computer processors is helpful but is not required.
