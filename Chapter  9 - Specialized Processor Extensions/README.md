# Chapter 9 - Specialized Processor Extensions

In the preceding chapters, we discussed the attributes of general-purpose computer architectures as well as some architectural specializations intended to address domain-specific requirements. This chapter will focus on extensions commonly implemented at the processor instruction set level to provide additional system capabilities beyond generic computing needs. 

After reading this chapter, you will understand the purpose of privileged processor modes and how they are used in multiprocessing and multiuser contexts. You will be familiar with the concepts of floating-point processors and instruction sets, techniques for power management in battery-powered devices, and processor features intended to enhance system security.

We will discuss the following features in this chapter:
* Privileged processor modes
* Floating-point mathematics
* Power management
* System security management
