# Chapter 14, Exercise 3

Work through the example quantum program at https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/fundamentals/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html. This example creates a quantum circuit containing three qubits that implements a **Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ)** state. The GHZ state exhibits key properties of quantum entanglement. Execute the code in a simulation environment on your computer.
