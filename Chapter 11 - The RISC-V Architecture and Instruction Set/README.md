# Chapter 11 - The RISC-V Architecture and Instruction Set

This chapter introduces the exciting, comparatively new RISC-V (pronounced *risk five*) processor architecture and its instruction set. RISC-V is a completely open source, free to use, specification for a reduced instruction set processor. A complete user-mode (non-privileged) instruction set specification has been released and several inexpensive hardware implementations of this architecture are currently available. Work is ongoing to develop specifications for a number of instruction set extensions to support general-purpose computing applications, high-performance computing, and embedded applications requiring minimal code size. Processors are commercially available that implement many of these developmental extensions.

This chapter covers the baseline features and extensions available in the RISC-V architecture and introduces the RISC-V instruction set. 

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* RISC-V architecture and features
* RISC-V base instruction set
* RISC-V extensions
* 64-bit RISC-V
* Standard RISC-V configurations
* RISC-V assembly language
* Implementing RISC-V in an FPGA

After completing this chapter, you will understand the architecture and capabilities of the RISC-V processor and its optional extensions. You will have learned the basics of the RISC-V instruction set and will understand how RISC-V can be tailored to support a variety of computer architectures, from low-end embedded systems, to warehouse-scale cloud server farms. You will also have learned how to implement a RISC-V processor in a low-cost FPGA board.
