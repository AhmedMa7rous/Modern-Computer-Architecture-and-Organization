# Chapter 11, Exercise 2

With the project from Exercise 1 still open, locate the **hello.c** file in the **src** folder in the **Project** window. Right-click on the file and rename it to **hello.s**. Open **hello.s** in the editor and delete the entire contents. Insert the assembly language program shown in the *RISC-V assembly language* section in this chapter. Perform a clean and then rebuild the project (press *Ctrl+9* to initiate the clean operation). Select **Debug** under the **Run** menu. Once the debugger starts, open windows to display the **hello.s** source file, the **Disassembly** window, and the **Registers** window. Expand the **Registers** tree to display the RISC-V processor registers. Single-step through the program and verify the text *Hello, Computer Architect!* appears in the Console window.
