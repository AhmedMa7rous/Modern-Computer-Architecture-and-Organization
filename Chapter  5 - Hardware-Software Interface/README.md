# Chapter 5 - Hardware-Software Interface

The vast majority of computer software is not written at the processor instruction level, in assembly language. Instead, each application you work with on a daily basis was written in a one high-level programming language or another, using a pre-built library of capabilities that the application programmers extended during the software development process. Practical programming environments, consisting of programming languages and their associated libraries, must offer many high-level services such as disk I/O, network communications, and interactions with users that are easily accessible from programming languages. 

This chapter describes the software layers that implement these features beginning at the level of processor instructions in device drivers. Several key aspects of operating systems will be covered in this chapter including booting, multithreading, and multiprocessing. After completing this chapter, you will have a broad understanding of how the multiple levels of system software interact with computer hardware components to perform useful communication with peripheral devices and with users.

We will cover the following topics:
* Device drivers
* BIOS
* The boot process
* Operating systems
* Processes and threads
* Multiprocessing
