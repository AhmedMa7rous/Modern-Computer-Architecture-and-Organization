# Chapter 3 - Processor Elements

This chapter begins our development of a comprehensive understanding of modern processor architectures. Building upon the basic digital circuits introduced in Chapter 2, we discuss the functional units of a simple, generic computer processor. Concepts related to the instruction set and register set are introduced, followed by a discussion of the steps involved in instruction loading, decoding, execution, and sequencing. Addressing modes and instruction categories are discussed in the context of the 6502 architecture. The need for processor interrupt handling is introduced, using the example of 6502 interrupt processing. The standard approaches modern processors employ for input and output operations are introduced, including direct memory access.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* A generic processor
* The instruction set
* Addressing modes
* Instruction categories
* Interrupt processing
* Input/output operations
