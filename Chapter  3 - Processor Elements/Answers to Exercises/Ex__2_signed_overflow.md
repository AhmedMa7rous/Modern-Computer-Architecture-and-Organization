# Chapter 3, Exercise 2

If the answer to exercise 1 is “no,” this implies the only way to create a signed overflow is to add two numbers of the same sign. If an overflow occurs, what can you say about the result of performing XOR between the most significant bit of each operand with the most significant bit of the result? In other words, what will be the result of the expressions **left(7) XOR result(7)** and **right(7) XOR result(7)**? In these expressions, **(7)** indicates bit 7, the most significant bit.
