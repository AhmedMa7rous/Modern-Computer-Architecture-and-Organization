# Chapter 3, Exercise 1

Consider the addition of two signed 8-bit numbers (that is, numbers in the range -128 to +127) where one operand is positive and the other is negative. Is there any pair of 8-bit numbers of different signs that, when added together, will exceed the range -128 to +127? This would constitute a signed overflow. Note: We’re only looking at addition here because, as we’ve seen, subtraction in the 6502 architecture is the same as addition with the right operand’s bits inverted.
