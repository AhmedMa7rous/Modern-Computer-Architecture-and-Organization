__Modern Computer Architecture and Organization__, by Jim Ledin. Published by Packt Publishing.
# Chapter 4 - Computer System Components

This chapter begins with an introduction to the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor, which is used extensively in memory circuits and in most other modern digital devices. Next, we examine the design of computer memory circuits based on MOS transistors and their connection to the processor. Weâ€™ll look at modern computer input/output interfaces, with a focus on the use of high-speed serial connections within a computer system and over cable connections to external peripherals. Specific requirements for I/O devices including the graphics display, network interface, keyboard, and mouse will be covered. The chapter ends with a descriptive example of the specifications for a modern computer motherboard. Upon completing this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the hardware components of modern computer systems from technical specifications down to the circuit level.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* Digital switching circuits based on the MOSFET 
* Constructing DRAM circuits with MOSFETs 
* Memory subsystem
* Input/output subsystems
* Graphics display interfaces
* Network interface
* Keyboard and mouse
* Modern computer system specifications
