# Answer
Install Visual Studio Community as described in the exercise description above, then install the **Desktop development with C++** workload within Visual Studio Community.

Create your assembly language source file. See [Ex__1_hello_x86.asm](src/Ex__1_hello_x86.asm) for an example solution to this exercise.
 
Open the **x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019** and change to the directory containing your source file.
 
Build the executable with this command:
```
ml /Fl /Zi /Zd Ex__1_hello_x86.asm
```

Run the executable with this command:
```
C:\>Ex__1_hello_x86.executable
```

The following output should appear:
```
Hello, Computer Architect!
```
