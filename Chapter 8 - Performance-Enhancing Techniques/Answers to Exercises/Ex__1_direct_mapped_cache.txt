Chapter 8, Exercise 1: Consider a direct-mapped L1-I cache of 32KB. Each cache line consists of 64 bytes and the system address space is 4GB. How many bits are in the cache tag? Which bit numbers (bit 0 is the least significant bit) are they within the address word?

The cache contains 32,768 bytes with 64 bytes in each line. There are 32,768 / 64 = 512 sets in the cache. 512 = 2^9. The set number is thus 9 bits in length.

Each cache line contains 64 (2^6) bytes, which means the lower 6 bits of each address represent the byte offset within the cache line.

A 4GB address space requires 32-bit addresses. Subtracting the 9 bits in the set number and the 6 bits in the byte offset from the 32-bit address results in 32 - (9 + 6) = 17 bits in the cache tag.

The cache tage lies in the 17 most significant bits of the address, so the range of these bits within a 32-bit address runs from bit 15 to bit 31.
