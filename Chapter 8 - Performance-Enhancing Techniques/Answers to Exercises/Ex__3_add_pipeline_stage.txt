Chapter 8, Exercise 3: A processor has a 4-stage pipeline with maximum delays of 0.8, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.3 nanoseconds in stages 1-4, respectively. If the first stage is replaced with two stages that have maximum delays of 0.5 and 0.3 nanoseconds respectively, how much will the processor clock speed increase in percentage terms?

The maximum clock speed is determined by the slowest pipeline stage. The 4-stage pipeline has a slowest stage that takes 0.8ns. The maximum clock frequency is 1 / 0.8e-9 = 1.25GHz.

The 5-stage pipeline has a slowest stage of 0.6ns. The maximum clock frequency is 1 / 0.6e-9 = 1.667GHz.

The clock frequency increase resulting from the addition of the pipeline stage is 100 * (1.667e9 - 1.25e9) / 1.25e9 = 33.3%.
