# Chapter 7 - Processor and Memory Architectures

This chapter takes a deeper look at modern processor architectures, specifically the von Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard variants, and the computing domains in which each architecture tends to be applied. The concepts and benefits of paged virtual memory, used extensively in consumer and business computing and in portable electronic devices, are also introduced. We will examine the practical details of memory management in the real-world context of Windows NT (and later Windows versions). We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the features and functions of a generalized memory management unit.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the key features of modern processor architectures and their use of physical and virtual memory. You will also gain an understanding of the benefits of memory paging and the functions of the memory management unit.

This chapter covers the following topics:

* The von Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard architectures
* Physical and virtual memory
* Paged virtual memory
* Memory management unit
