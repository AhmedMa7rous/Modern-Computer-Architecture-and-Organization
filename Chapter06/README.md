# Chapter 6 - Specialized Computing Domains

Most computer users are at least conceptually familiar with key performance-related attributes of personal computers and mobile digital devices such as processor speed and RAM size. This chapter explores the performance requirements of computing domains that tend to be less directly visible to users, including real-time systems, digital signal processing, and GPU processing. 

We will examine the unique computing features associated with each of these domains and reviews some examples of modern devices implementing these concepts.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to identify the types of application areas that require real-time computing and will understand the uses of digital signal processing, with an emphasis on wireless communication. You will also understand the basic architecture of modern GPUs and will be familiar with some modern implementations of systems in the computing domains discussed in this chapter.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* Real-time computing
* Digital signal processing
* GPU processing
* Examples of specialized architectures
