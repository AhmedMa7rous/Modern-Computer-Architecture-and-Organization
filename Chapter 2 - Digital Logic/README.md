# Modern Computer Architecture and Organization
## Chapter 2 - Digital Logic

This chapter builds upon the introductory topics presented in Chapter 1 and provides a firm understanding of the digital building blocks used in the design of modern processors. We begin with a discussion of the properties of electrical circuits, then introduce transistors and examine their use as switching elements in logic gates. Latches, flip-flops, and ring counters are constructed from basic logic gates. More complex components, including registers and adders, are developed by combining the devices introduced earlier. The concept of sequential logic, meaning logic that contains state information that varies over time, is developed. The chapter ends with an introduction to hardware description languages, which are the preferred design method for complex digital devices.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* Electrical circuits
* The transistor
* Logic gates
* Latches and flip-flops
* Registers and adders
* Sequential logic
* Hardware description languages
